# PyImgSearch_Projects
The following is a collection of worked projects from [*PyImageSearch*](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/).

All credit for the original code, even when modified, goes to [*Adrian Rosebrock*](https://github.com/jrosebr1/) of PyImageSearch.

For more project ideas and a deeper understanding of the concepts used within the following projects, please visit his website. Not only do I recommend his blog; but, I, also, highly recommend his books -- especially his [*"Deep Learning for Computer Vision"*](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/) and [*"Raspberry Pi For Comput Vision"*](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/raspberry-pi-for-computer-vision/) (if interested in embedded computer vision).
