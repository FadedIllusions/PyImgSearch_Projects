# PyImgSearch_Projects
The following is a collection of worked projects from PyImageSearch (http://www.pyimagesearch.com/).

All credit for the original code, even when modified, goes to Adrian Rosebrock of PyImageSearch. His GitHub can be found at: https://github.com/jrosebr1/ and, of course, he can be found at his website above.

For more project ideas and a deeper understanding of the concepts used within the following projects, please visit his website. Not only do I recommend his blog; but, I, also, highly recommend his books -- especially his "Deep Learning for Computer Vision" and "Raspberry Pi For Comput Vision" (if interested in embedded computer vision).
